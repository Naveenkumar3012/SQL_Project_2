## Solutions
Problem 1 :
```sql
select category, count(1) as number_of_bikes
from bike
group by category
having count(1) > 2
```

Problem 2:
```sql
select c.name, count(m.id) as membership_count 
from membership m
right join customer c on c.id=m.customer_id
group by c.name
order by count(1) desc;
```

Problem 3:
```sql
select id, category
, price_per_hour as old_price_per_hour
, case when category = 'electric' then round(price_per_hour - (price_per_hour*0.1) ,2)
	   when category = 'mountain bike' then round(price_per_hour - (price_per_hour*0.2) ,2)
       else round(price_per_hour - (price_per_hour*0.5) ,2)
  end as new_price_per_hour
, price_per_day as old_price_per_day
, case when category = 'electric' then round(price_per_day - (price_per_day*0.2) ,2)
	   when category = 'mountain bike' then round(price_per_day - (price_per_day*0.5) ,2)
       else round(price_per_day - (price_per_day*0.5) ,2)
  end as new_price_per_day
from bike;
```

Problem 4:
```sql
select category,
count(case when status = 'available' then 1 end) as available_bikes_count,
count(case when status = 'rented' then 1 else 0 end)as rented_bikes_count
from bike
group by category
```

Problem 5:
```sql
select extract(year from start_timestamp) as year
, extract(month from start_timestamp) as month
, sum(total_paid) as revenue
from rental
group by extract(year from start_timestamp), extract(month from start_timestamp)
union all
select extract(year from start_timestamp) as year
, null as month, sum(total_paid) as revenue
from rental
group by extract(year from start_timestamp)
union all
select null as year, null as month, sum(total_paid) as revenue
from rental
order by year, month;
```

Problem 6:
```sql
select extract(year from start_date) as year
, extract(month from start_date) as month
, mt.name as membership_type_name
, sum(total_paid) as total_revenue
from membership m
join membership_type mt on m.membership_type_id = mt.id
group by year, month, mt.name
order by year, month, mt.name
```

problem 6(solution 2)
```sql
select extract(year from start_timestamp) as year
, extract(month from start_timestamp) as month
, sum(total_paid) as revenue
from rental
group by rollup(year, month)
order by year, month;
```

Problem 7:
```sql
select mt.name as membership_type_name
, extract(month from start_date) as month
, sum(total_paid) as total_revenue
from membership m
join membership_type mt on m.membership_type_id = mt.id
where extract(year from start_date) = 2023
group by CUBE(membership_type_name, month)
order by membership_type_name, month;
```

Problem 8:
```sql
with cte as 
    (select customer_id, count(1)
    , case when count(1) > 10 then 'more than 10' 
           when count(1) between 5 and 10 then 'between 5 and 10'
           else 'fewer than 5'
      end as category
    from rental
    GROUP by customer_id)
select category as rental_count_category
, count(*) as customer_count
from cte 
group by category
order by customer_count;
```
